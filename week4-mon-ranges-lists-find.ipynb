A range isn't a list, however, which mostly matters if you try to print it, though you can wrap it in the aptly-named `list()` function to turn it into a list if you ever need to. Try adding a line to do that, and to print out the resulting list, below. "

First, let's take a text. We'll use a sonnet, since poems are shorter than novels and it's helpful to be able to type it out in full. This one's by Edna St. Vincent Millay, and like everything she wrote, it's beautiful, austere and depressing. You can replace it with something more upbeat and the code should still work fine. "
