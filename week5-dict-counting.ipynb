    "The basic counting idiom in python is just a formalization of how we count things in regular life. Arrange them into a set of things of the general type to be counted, then go through them one by one, making a note of each that meets some criterion. \n",
    "\n",
    "That's a fancy way of saying, if you want to count words, you need words; if you want to do letters, you want letters. Don't try to count words with a pile of letters; transform them into words first.\n",
    "\n",
    "Counting many words as once takes advantage of the name-based strucutre of a dictionary to keep all of the separate counts divided up, but it's fundamentally not that different from counting instances of one word. Noteably, you don't loop over the dictionary or digest your text into a new format. As before, we almost certainly just want a list of all the words in order (actually, they don't have to be in order for this, as we'll see later in the course—all that matters is that we have an easy way to go through them all).\n",

    "If we loop over a dictionary, we just get the keys; it's the equivalent of looping over `dict.keys()`. That might suggest we try looping over `dict.values()` but that won't print the keys, which is probably even less helpful. Of course, you could loop over the values and for each of them, `print(f'{key} : {dict[key]}')` but there's an easier way. `dict.items()` returns a list of what in python are called tuples. A **tuple** (a double, triple etc) is kind of like a list, except you can't change it in any way. It's a useful way to package together information that doesn't make much sense without it's other parts, or to show that the individual pieces won't be updated in any way.\n",
