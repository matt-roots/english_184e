    "The theme for today's class is repeating things. Or, rather, it's getting started with making python repeat things. At its most basic level, most of the revolution in computation over the last 100 years, from adding machines and mechanical calculators onwards, has been about making computers do simple things over and over again, faster and faster. Making use of this power consists mostly of figuring out how to reduce complicated tasks down to simple ones. Modern computers provide many levels of **abstraction** to help with this, by hiding the details of how things work. Abstraction is a bottom-up view of the same hierarchy of complexity: computers, for example, deal in binary, but in python, we get to use base 10. Or, more relevant to this course, we get to deal with texts, and rely on Unicode to convert letters and symbols into numbers, which in turn get converted into 1s and 0s and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a high level language, which means we only have to break things down so far (no 1s and 0s needed), and we get a lot of tools to help with the job. One caveat, though: if we want to make python do things over and over (and we doâ€”have you ever counted the words in a novel by hand?\\*) we're going to have to keep track of them, which means we have to learn to count like python.\n",
